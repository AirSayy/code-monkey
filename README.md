# CODE-Monkey

I am driven by puzzels and codewars gives me that. Its challenges keeps me up-to date with recent algorithm patterns and better understanding about the language you work with.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript , TypeScript

Solving code everyday and practice code algorithms , this has built my confidence in javascript algorithms continually. When im not working on my projects, you can find me solving code-wars and pushing the solutions here.



## Lessons Learned:

Code-wars gives you beautiful insights about programming languages, data structures and algorithm.
Improvements in my problem solving skills and speed.
Different types of algorithms that gives you same possible solution.
Helps you write clean codes.
