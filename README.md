**Tech used:** JavaScript

I solve code challenges everyday and practice code algorithms , this has built my confidence in javascript algorithms continually. When im not working on my projects, you can find me solving code-wars and pushing the solutions here.



## Lessons Learned:

Code-wars gives you beautiful insights about programming languages.
Improvements in my problem solving skills and speed.
Different types of programming patterns that gives you same answers.
Helps you write clean codes.
