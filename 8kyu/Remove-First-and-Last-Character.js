//It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
 //SOLUTION

//  function removeChar(str){
//     //You got this!
//      let removeFirstChar= str.slice(1)
//      let removeLastChar= removeFirstChar.slice(0 , -1)
//      return removeLastChar
//    };
